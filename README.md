# Matt Lester – Engineering Portfolio
Welcome to my professional portfolio, showcasing a range of multidisciplinary projects that blend mechanical engineering, software automation, and hands-on fabrication. This collection highlights my approach to problem-solving — from concept and design to implementation and testing — across both professional and personal work.

# Engineering Portfolio (GitHub Pages project site)

This repository hosts a static portfolio site for Matt Lester.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `engineering-portfolio`).
2. Upload these files to the repo root (or clone & push).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: `Deploy from a branch`**, then select **Branch: `main`** and **Folder: `/ (root)`**. Save.
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes for deployment. Your site will be live at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

## Customize
- Replace `images/favicon.svg` and add actual photos under `images/...`.
- Put your resume PDF at `resume/Resume.pdf` (or change the nav link).
- Edit contact links in `about.html` and `index.html`.
- Update project links in `projects.html` to point to your PDFs and galleries (`docs/...` and `images/...`).

## Optional
- Create `docs/` folders for PDFs and code snippets.
- If using underscores in folders, `.nojekyll` prevents Jekyll processing.
